We just found an ID card in the parking lot of the Attackistan branch of Lawl.org.

Let's take baby steps, first step, run your reader and make sure the ID on the card matches the number on the back.

Baby step two, run the card on the Find Me card reader. Make sure the name it shows matches your card.

Your card has been reported missing! Figure out how to make it work to get into the front door!

The card reader in the Management Lounge will let anyone that's part of the Management Department in. They have the best donuts in the morning! Get into the Management Lounge!

Now that we're full on donuts, let's head over to the IT department and grab a cubicle. Anyone in the IT department should let you in.

The Management department did a donut count, and their on to you! Go get a disquise from the Janitorial closet before someone catches you with donut residue! Any valid janitor card should get you in!

Espionage time! Get a listing of the clients from the Accounting department. The head of Accounting is Marcelina Stancill, she's the only one with access to the accounting room.

Ok, time for one more task before we make our escape. The CEO of the Attackistan branch of Lawl.org is Cornell Popovich. He's known to keep his password on a yellow sticky in his office. He's also the only one with access to his office. We've killed the cameras, go get that password!
